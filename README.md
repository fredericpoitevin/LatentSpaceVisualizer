# LatentSpaceVisualizer

The Latent Space Visualizer is an interactive Python notebook that visualizes the latent space of an image dataset. The dataset contains a collection of latent variables that describes a set of labeled images. 

Two variables of the latent space are displayed in a 2D scatter plot. When the mouse is positioned near a point in the scatter plot, the image corresponding to that point is displayed to the side, as shown in Figure 1.
